# pytorchfire


Summer 2025: 
Currently reconstructing a [research paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.18738) based on stochastic fire modeling to better predict wildfires. The model uses gradient descent amongst other things to accurately predict where the wildfire will spread. 

What's included:
- custom hyperparameters
- training
- metrics (before and after calibration)
- more metrics on metrics

more info soon.
